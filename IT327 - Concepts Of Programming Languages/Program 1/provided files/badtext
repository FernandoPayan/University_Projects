We need to buy 3 more computers, but 1st I
want to get 2 more desks, so that we have
plenty.  I just don't think 8 is enough
for 18 students.  How did they ever think we
could get by with just 5?

The 2nd item on the agenda is coffee.  We're
going through 3 pounds a week.  This is the
8th time this issue has come up, so let's
try to cut back, or we'll have to start
charging 30 cents a cup instead of 20.
